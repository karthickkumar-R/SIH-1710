## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea
Develop a multi-platform intelligent navigation system tailored for railway stations that helps passengers easily find facilities and destinations inside complex station premises.

Use 3D interactive maps for better spatial understanding.

Incorporate real-time updates for dynamic changes like platform shifts, maintenance areas, or new facility openings.

Provide voice-guided navigation and accessibility features for differently-abled passengers.

Deploy on mobile apps, digital kiosks, and integrate with existing railway apps.

Use Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth beacons, or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) for accurate real-time passenger localization.

Leverage AI & ML to optimize routes based on congestion and user preferences.

Include multi-lingual support for diverse passenger demographics.

## Proposed Solution
High-Level Architecture Components:
1.User Interface Layer:

  Mobile Application (iOS, Android)

  Digital Kiosks (Touch-screen interfaces)

  Voice Assistant Interface

2.Navigation Engine:

  Indoor Positioning System Module (Bluetooth Beacons, Wi-Fi RTT, UWB)

  Map Rendering Service (3D interactive maps)

  Route Optimization Engine (AI/ML-based pathfinding)

  Accessibility Module (voice guidance, high contrast mode)

3.Backend Services:

  Facility & Location Database (updated in real-time)

  Real-time Event Management (track changes like delays, maintenance)

  User Preferences & Profile Management

Integration APIs (with railway existing apps, ticketing systems)

4.Data Sources:

  Station Layout & Facilities GIS data

  Real-time updates feed (from station management)

Sensor data (for positioning)

5.Communication & Sync:

  Push Notifications for updates

  Sync between kiosks, apps, and backend
